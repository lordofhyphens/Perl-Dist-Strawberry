NAME
    Perl::Dist::Strawberry - Build strawberry-perl-like distribution for MS
    Windows

DESCRIPTION
    Strawberry Perl is a binary distribution of Perl for the Windows
    operating system. It includes a bundled compiler and pre-installed
    modules that offer the ability to install XS CPAN modules directly from
    CPAN.

    You can download Strawberry Perl from <http://strawberryperl.com>

    The purpose of the Strawberry Perl series is to provide a practical
    Win32 Perl environment for experienced Perl developers to experiment
    with and test the installation of various CPAN modules under Win32
    conditions, and to provide a useful platform for doing real work.

    Perl::Dist::Strawberry is just a helper module for the main script
    perldist_strawberry used for building Strawberry perl release packages
    (MSI, ZIP).

	This script has been modified for use of locally-hosted external libraries
	and mingw64-6.3.0 with seh exceptions (instead of sjlj). It is intended to 
	support development of Slic3r <http://slic3r.org>.

	It provides fewer CPAN packages as well.
